# 🌐 CS50 Personal Website

This project was created for **Harvard’s CS50x Problem Set 8: Homepage**.  
It is a multi-page personal website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**.

The site includes four pages:  
- **Home:** Introduces me with a short bio, profile image, and highlights of skills like Python, SQL, and C.  
- **About:** A brief description of who I am.  
- **Contact:** Contains my email address for communication.  
- **/now:** Lists what I’m currently working on — CS50, studying AI/ML, and reading.

The design uses **Bootstrap 5.3** for responsive layout and structure, with a **custom CSS stylesheet** for color and styling.  
A **JavaScript-based Dark Mode** button toggles a `dark-mode` class on the `<body>` element to switch between light and dark themes.

This project demonstrates understanding of **semantic HTML**, **responsive web design**, **multi-page navigation**, and **basic interactivity**.
